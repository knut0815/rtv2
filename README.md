## Overview
<p>Our understanding of the world and technology is rapidly growing, and one of the most obvious signs of that is the
rapid advancement of Computer Graphics (CG). We see it in movies, games, virtual reality, etc. Essentially every form of digital entertainment aims to captivate its audience by immersing them in worlds that grow harder and harder to distinguish from reality. The industry continues to push these boundaries every day, and the lines between these simulated worlds and our really beginning to blur.</p>
<p>We are CLIVE (Computed Light in Virtual Evironments) and we have set out to build our own photorealstic renderer from the
ground up. Along our journey, we will share with you all of the struggles and breakthroughs as we trudge the treachorous path of academic papers and PhD theses that litters the world of CG, and build a bridge for all the people interested in this amazing field that don't have the industry experience they need to get off the ground.</p>

This project is a work in progress. We have weekly updates on our blog: [link here] as well as a github webpage: [link here]
